# Overview

This 1.5-hour crash course introduces you to the basics of the Ruby programming language and Rails framework (Ruby on Rails). The project is similar to what you would learn at the beginning of week 9 of our 16-week Immersive Web Engineering course. The project walks through how to build an IoT website where you can turn a desk lamp on and off right from your browser!

# Outcomes

Attendees leave the class with a one page Ruby on Rails site that can turn a lamp on and off. The lamp hardware is not included, and is **OPTIONAL**. If you want to build the lamp controller it will cost $19-24 and a parts list is below in the optional requirements.

# Requirements

 * Laptop that is WiFi capable. Laptops are required to complete the course. However, if you do not have one and would simply like to attend as an observer, you're certainly welcome to sign up and you'll still learn a lot!

 * Atom (text editor), download here: https://atom.io/

 * Course materials, download here: [GIT REPO COMING SOON]

# Optional Requirements

Hardware is optional, you can come and watch the demo even if you don't buy anything. But for those that want a complete project you'll want to buy a switch.

Two options are listed below. You'll need an extension cord and the parts from option 1 __OR__ option 2.

[Overview Video]() of how to assemble the hardware.

### You'll Need

* 8' Extension Cord: [$8 Grounded Extension Cord](http://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-8-ft-3-Outlet-Grounded-Office-Extension-Cord-50251/203806463)

__Option 1 - USB Based System ($16):__

* Arduino: [$10 Microcontroller](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compatible-Arduino/dp/B01EWOE0UU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1494870395&sr=8-5&keywords=arduino)
* Relay: [$2.50 10A Relay](https://www.amazon.com/TOOGOO-2-Channel-Module-Arduino-Electronic/dp/B00MN91LOA/ref=sr_1_24?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1494870792&sr=1-24&keywords=arduino+relay+board)
* Electrical box: [$1 Electrical Box](http://www.homedepot.com/p/1-Gang-14-cu-in-Old-Work-Box-B114RB/100404027)
* Electrical Outlet: [$2 Outlet](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-Prograde-15-Amp-Double-Pole-Duplex-Outlet-White-R62-CBR15-00W/202066707)
* Cover Plate: [$1.50 Cover Plate](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-Decora-2-Gang-Midway-1-Duplex-Outlet-Combination-Nylon-Wall-Plate-White-R52-PJ826-00W/202059789)

__Option 2 - Wifi Based System ($11):__

* Wifi Switch: [$5 Sonoff](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-wifi-wireless-switch.html)
* FTDI Adapter to reprogram Sonoff: [$6 FTDI](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Ft232rl-Serial-Adapter-Arduino/dp/B00IJXZQ7C/)
* __NOTE:__ This option requires reprograming the micro controller on the Sonoff, and this is __more complex__ than Option 1. This makes for a cooler project, but can be difficult as your first IoT build.

Prices are listed as time of writing and exclude cost of shipping, handling, and tax.
